1) The code will print "3" because the for loop iterates 3 times.
2) The code will print "150", which is the discounted price of the final item of the input array.
3) The code will print "150", which is the discounted price of the final item of the input array after rounding to the nearest hundredths place.
4) The function will return a list of the prices after applying the discount to every item. In the for loop, the final discounted price is pushed, or added, to the array "discounted", which is what is returned at the end of the function.
5) The code will return an error, because line 12 is outside of the block that "i" was defined in, and so the variable is outside of the scope that can be accessed by line 12.
6) The code will return an error, because line 13 is outside of the black that "discountedPrice" was defined in, so the variable cannot be accessed.
7) The code will print "150", because that is the last value calculated for "finalPrice" and thus the final value assigned to the variable.
8) The code will return an array of the discounted prices, since "discounted" is the array that holds the values of the final discounted prices after calculations.
9) The code will return an error, because line 11 is outside of the block that "i" was defined in.
10) The code will print "3", because that is the length of the input array.
11) The function will return the array of discounted prices, because the new prices were added to the array in the function and the variable was unchanged.

    a) student.name
    
    b) student['Grad Year']

    e) student.courseLoad[0]
    
13) Q13
    
    a) '3' + 2 = '32', because 2 is converted to a string.
    
    b) '3' - 2 = 1, because '3' is converted to an integer.
    
    c) 3 + null = 0, because null is treated as 0.
    
    d) '3' + null = '3null', because null is converted to a string.
    
    e) true + 3 = 4, because true is treated as 1.
    
    f) false + null = 0, because both false and null are treated as 0.
    
    g) '3' + undefined = '3undefined', because undefined is converted to a string.
    
    h) '3' - undefined = NaN, because undefined cannot be converted to an integer.
    
14) Q14

    a) '2' > 1 = true, because '2' is converted to 2, which is greater than 1.
    
    b) '2' < '12' = false, because '1' is less than '2' in lexicographical ordering.
    
    c) 2 == '2' = true, because '2' is converted to 2, which is what is on the left side.
    
    d) 2 === '2' = false, because the two sides are different types.
    
    e) true == 2 = false, because true is converted to the integer 1, which is not equal to 2.
    
    f) true === Boolean(2) = true, because Boolean(2) = true, so both sides are the same.
    
    
15) == tries to convert the two sides of the comparison to the same type before checking if they are equal, while === directly checks if the two sides are equal.
16) 
17) The function would return [2,4,6]. Since we do modifyArray([1,2,3], doSomething), and the function doSomething just doubles an number, the function modifyArray will iterate through the array we input, pass each entry through the function doSomething, and add the result to an array that the function returns at the end. Thus, we will bet an array with entries that are twice the values of the entries of the original array.
