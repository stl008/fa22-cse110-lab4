1) The code will print "3" because the for loop iterates 3 times.
2) The code will print "150", which is the discounted price of the final item of the input array.
3) The code will print "150", which is the discounted price of the final item of the input array after rounding to the nearest hundredths place.
4) The function will return a list of the prices after applying the discount to every item. In the for loop, the final discounted price is pushed, or added, to the array "discounted", which is what is returned at the end of the function.
5) The code will return an error, because line 12 is outside of the block that "i" was defined in, and so the variable is outside of the scope that can be accessed by line 12.
6) The code will return an error, because line 13 is outside of the black that "discountedPrice" was defined in, so the variable cannot be accessed.
7) The code will print "150", because that is the last value calculated for "finalPrice" and thus the final value assigned to the variable.
8) The code will return an array of the discounted prices, since "discounted" is the array that holds the values of the final discounted prices after calculations.
